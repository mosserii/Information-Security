Q4 - he is just looking for a pattern (maybe there are 5 of them) so we can put twice 2
I noticed that because Bob does not know JSON, they read the script in a different way!

{"hola \"command": "echo hacked", "command": "echo cool",
"signature": "007152ab1a65e9e864928d0f5cc6f47e8ce6217c09f7e7518d3d15f901e33df7e4bd760e2538929bdf2c5bf710b2babbcb2f268f458551ecbee78df22f3bb039696a2fccf58ccdeeb0c235e36593aa4b8be3d62e4ae6a59f6aebf78e3aec5b1685672bff191969731a096fa8f9ef29926bbee303d0673482410a25d00c46bdc1"}

Bob is using re.search(r'"command": "(.*?)"', data).group(1)
and therefore, I created another key:value in the script in JSON so that its key
will be slightly different then command. Alice will read only from "command" key in the JSON script,
 and she will compare the "echo cool" with its correct signature, without noticing our new key:value.
while Bob will still find our malicious key instead of the normal "command" key
and think it is from the pattern : "command": "(.*?)", therefore he will execute it.
