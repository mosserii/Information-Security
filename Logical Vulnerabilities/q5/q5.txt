Q5 - using subprocess because it takes a lot of time TOCTTOU

Sometimes too safe is not safe...
Alice made the verify function do 1000000 iterations of hashing which takes
a loooooot of time (15 seconds at least) so we can send it the actual file (example.json) that will be validated,
and once we know that in run.py, we arrived already to the verify function (say after 3 seconds),
we can change the json file dynamically!!

I created a subprocess that will RUN run.py, and then after 3 seconds,
 with the main process, I changed the example.json file so that his value to command key will be "echo hacked".


#I change the example.json file so if you want to rerun it, you should change back :
"command": "echo hacked" to "command": "echo cool" 

#maybe it would not work on a super computer (because we wait 3 seconds),
so we can tailor it to each computer/try many different times.
