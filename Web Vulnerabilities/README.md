### **Web Vulnerabilities**

In this exercise, we exploit XSS, CSRF and more web vulnerabilities in a forum system.

Q1 : 
Cookies theft - Login to a user account using his cookie (via the console in chrome), calculating his cookie using a function.

Q2 : 
Stored XSS - make every user that logs-in to send a message of "Good Morning!".

Q3 : 
Stored XSS - post an image using JAVASCRIPT onload attribute in img tags, so that every user will see it only once (then it becomes transparent).

Q4 : 
SQL injection - change users passwords using SQL injection.

Q5 :
