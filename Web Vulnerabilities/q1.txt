Q1 - login as edward (using his cookie)
In server.py, login_required function calls validate_login in model.py which takes the cookie and use it for login details:

login = base64.b64decode(cookie).decode()

this line decodes the cookie, and then uses : 

"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?",
            (login,)



Therefore, I created a cookie for edward using the inverse command so that login will equal "edward":
base64.b64encode("edward".encode()).decode()

**in CONSOLE : document.cookie = 'login=ZWR3YXJk'


Just printed it in python and got "ZWR3YXJk" so that is edward's login cookie.
