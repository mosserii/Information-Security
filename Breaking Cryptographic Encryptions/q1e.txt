The main "key" for this part is to notice that by definition of encryption in this assignment,
letter (i) and letter (i+key_length) in cipher were encrypted with the same byte of KEY.
Therefore, we can split the cipher into pieces such that in each piece, all the elements were encrypted with the same byte of KEY.

Then, for each piece we look for the byte that decrypting the elements in that piece will get the highest score 
and then putting all the bytes (in order, obviously) together into one KEY.

finally, we can just decrypt the cipher with that KEY.
