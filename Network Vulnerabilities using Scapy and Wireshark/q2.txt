As in q1, I checked if there is a try to reach the course website. 

if there is, I created a packet to send back (switches between src & dst IP and ports). also i added that the ack back will be added with the size of the packet, meaning that the server received the client request to connect ot the course website.
 
I added the flags FA : finish and ack, meaning that : 

F = When the receiving party receives a TCP segment with the FIN flag set, it acknowledges the FIN and enters the TCP connection termination process.
A = The ACK flag is used to acknowledge the receipt of data. When closing a TCP connection, the ACK flag is set to acknowledge the receipt of the FIN segment from the other party.

and finally I put the IP and TCP segments together with the RESPONSE payload.
