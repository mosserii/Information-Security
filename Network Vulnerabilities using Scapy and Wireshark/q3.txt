is_packet_to_original_gateway : 

from the hint I figured out that I need to check if the packet was sent to the  gateway MAC address of the victim and that it was not us who sent it (not our_IP).


is_stolen_packet :
I checked if the packet dest_IP is not for us but the MAC_dest is still ours, which means it is a packet that was not meant to us but was redirected to us.

 

create_poison : 
arp_packet = S.ARP(
            op=2,  # 2 for ARP reply
            psrc=self.gateway_ip,  # Gateway_ip - Attacker says it is him
            hwdst=victim_packet[S.Ether].src,  # Victim's MAC address
            pdst=victim_packet[S.IP].src  # Victim's IP address
        )
In psrc I put the Gateway_ip, meaning that attacker says : "I'm Gateway_ip, my MAC is our_MAC" -> the mac addr of the attacker will be connected to the Gateway_ip.
hwdst, pdst are there so we will only poison the victim and not everyone on the web.
