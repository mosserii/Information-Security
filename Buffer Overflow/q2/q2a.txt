In this question, there is no check of the password length at all and therefore one can use the vulnerabillity of strcat.
again I caused a stackoverflow, running from buff to what is on top of it ($esp etc.).
because Buff is of length 65 and is declared at the beginning of sudo, it sits just under the return address etc.

like in class, I overrode these elements, causing a segmentation fault and also using letters (each one 5 times for a total of 75) so it will be easier to debug.
